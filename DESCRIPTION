Description: Implemented fast and memory-efficient Notch-filter, 
    Welch-periodogram, discrete wavelet spectrogram for minutes of 
    high-resolution signals, fast 3D convolution, image registration,
    3D mesh manipulation; providing fundamental toolbox for intracranial 
    Electroencephalography (iEEG) pipelines.
