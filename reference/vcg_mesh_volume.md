# Compute volume for manifold meshes

Compute volume for manifold meshes

## Usage

``` r
vcg_mesh_volume(mesh)
```

## Arguments

- mesh:

  triangular mesh of class `'mesh3d'`

## Value

The numeric volume of the mesh

## Coercing Surface Inputs

The surface objects are converted to `'mesh3d'` object before applying
further calculations.

When `surface` is a surface ieegio object, the returned `mesh3d$vb`
contains vertices that have been left-multiplied by
`surface$geometry$transforms[[1]]` (the first transform stored in the
geometry, typically the `ScannerAnat` or voxel-to-world transform).

**Breaking change:** Earlier versions (before 0.2.6) of ravetools
returned the raw `surface$geometry$vertices` without applying any
transform, so downstream code often multiplied by
`surface$geometry$transforms[[1]]` (or an equivalent) manually before
working in world space. Such code will now *double* apply the transform
and produce incorrect coordinates. If you previously applied a transform
from `surface$geometry$transforms` by hand after calling a ravetools
mesh function on an `'ieegio_surface'`, remove that manual step.

Surfaces with an empty or missing `geometry$transforms` list (for
example, surfaces produced by ieegio's `volume_to_surface`, which stores
an identity transform) are unaffected.

If `geometry$transforms` contains multiple transforms targeting
different coordinate spaces, only the first one is used. Callers that
need a specific target space should select and apply that transform
themselves before calling ravetools mesh functions.

## Examples

``` r

# Initial mesh
mesh <- vcg_sphere()

vcg_mesh_volume(mesh)
#> [1] 4.152741
```
